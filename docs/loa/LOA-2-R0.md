## 3. Scope

### 3.1
The information contained herein are supplementary to the rules established under VATSIM regulations, Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) used in the real world.

### 3.2
While such regulations shall generally be strictly followed on the VATSIM network, in some circumstances, exemptions or modifications to the real-world regulations are necessary due to operational need in an online environment. Such deviation shall be discussed in this document.

## 4. Disclosure
Both parties shall make this Letter of Agreement available for public access on their respective official websites. The information contained herein is for the exclusive use on the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM) only. Under no circumstances shall such information be used in the real world, including but not limited to, real-world air navigation or real-world air traffic control.

## 5. Language
This Letter of Agreement is officially and originally prepared and documented in the English language. Both parties are encouraged to translate this LOA into Korean and/or Simplified Chinese for reference purposes, but this is optional. The English version of this LOA shall always prevail, and future revisions to this LOA shall be based upon the English version.

## 6. General Procedures

### 6.1
Unless otherwise stated or coordinated, all transfers must be completed 10NM before the FIR boundary.

### 6.2
The separations between handovers need to be in accordance with the horizontal and vertical separations specified in ICAO Doc 4444.

### 6.3
There are differences between Mainland China's flight levels and international flight levels. To avoid this difference affecting traffic, all AGAVO, GOLOT, TOMUK handovers must be in meters and completed within Korea and all LAMEN handovers must be in feet and completed within Mainland China.

## 10. Special agreement 

### 10.1
The controlled airspace of Shanghai ACC is different from that of Shanghai FIR (shown in Figure 10.1).  Shanghai ACC sector 03 is located in the Incheon FIR (RKRR). For the details, on VATSIM, the airspace of VATKOR to the east and VATPRC to the west of the LAMEN fix(124 degrees east longitude) will be defined as the airspace of VATKOR and VATPRC. To comply with the will of both divisions and avoid hotspot conflicts, VATPRC and VATKOR agreed that when Korea ATC is offline, Shanghai ACC ATC can issue the aircraft to fly directly to SADLI or IKEDO.

### 10.2
To further avoid hotspot conflicts, VATPRC and VATKOR agreed to replace the direct flight request of each aircraft with one-time coordination of direct flights to SADLI/IKEDO when both ATCs are online. If either ATC becomes offline, the previous coordination will be deemed invalid.

### 10.3
The aircraft is required to maintain level flight before the handover 10nm from TCP, and all uncoordinated altitude changes shall be prohibited. If achieving the altitude agreed upon by both divisions is impossible, an alternative altitude may be assigned as an exception. However, in such cases, the counterpart ATC must be notified if they are online.

Should there be any changes to real-world procedures made by the local authorities, both parties shall decide whether an amendment to this LOA is necessary.

### 11.3
A content review of this LOA shall take at most six (6) months after this LOA takes effect. During the review, both parties shall convene to discuss the implementation of this LOA and make proper amendments to it if necessary.
