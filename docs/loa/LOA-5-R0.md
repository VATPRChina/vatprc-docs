### 2.2 General coordination procedures

In the People’s Republic of China metric level system applied, however imperial used in
Russia. Shenyang FIR controllers shall assign imperial flight levels for aircrafts joining
Khabarovsk FIR airspace and vice versa with metric flight levels from UHHH FIR. Level off
zone is established in 100 km/50 nm range from state border.

Standard vertical separation between aircrafts on same heading shall be 300m/1000ft, but
for any opposing traffic 600m/2000ft of vertical separation between them is established by
this LoA. It’s also important to check if aircraft have FPL with correct flight level, like metric
FL if crossing PRC airspace and imperial for UHHH airspace (Annex 1-2). When crossing state
border aircraft shall be handled to adjacent sector.

| ZYSH(ZYHB) | UHHH | ARGUK(E) |
| ZYSH(ZYHB) | UHHH | MAGIT(X) |
| ZYSH(ZYTL) | UHHH | BISUN(E/X) |

>[!NOTE]
> \*E – Entry point / X – exit point

#### For aircrafts arriving to Vladivostok airport (UHWW) following level restrictions are applied:

| FIR Exit Point | Vertical Limits |
| :------: | :-----------: |
| BISUN | FL210(FL190\*) |

### 2.4 Coordination procedures from UHHH to ZYSH

Aircraft leaving UHHH airspace shall be transferred to adjacent ZYSH FIR sector in following priority:
- ZYHB_CTR/ZYTL_CTR -> ZYSH_CTR -> PRC_FSS

#### Following exit points shall be used for aircraft joining ZYSH airspace:

| From FIR | To FIR | Entry/Exit Point |
| :------: | :----: | :----------: |
| UHHH | ZYSH(ZYHB) | SIMLI(E/X) |
| UHHH | ZYSH(ZYHB) | ARGUK(X) |
