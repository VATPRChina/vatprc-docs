**VATPRC Document Number:** VATPRC-LOA-4-R1-EN

**VCL vACC Document Number:** PRCVCL_2024

## 1. Purpose

This Letter of Agreement (LOA) establishes standard procedures and coordination responsibilities of air traffic control between Guangzhou FIR (ZGZU), Kunming FIR (ZPKM), Sanya FIR (ZJSA) of the People's Republic of China Division (VATPRC) and Ho Chi Minh FIR (VVHM), Hanoi FIR (VVHN), Vientiene FIR (VLVT) of Vietnam - Cambodia - Laos vACC, Southeast Asia Division (VATSEA).

## 2. Cancellation

This document supersedes any agreements previously established in verbal or written form between VATSEA and VATPRC.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1

The information contained herein is supplementary to the rules established under VATSIM regulations, Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam published by the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, AIP of Lao People's Democratic Republic published by the Department of Civil Aviation (Laos) and the AIP of the People's Republic of China published by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).

### 3.2

While such regulations shall generally be strictly followed on the VATSIM network, in some circumstances exemptions or modifications to the real-world regulations are necessary due to operational needs in an online environment. Such deviation shall be discussed in this document.

## 4. Disclosure

Both parties shall make this Letter of Agreement available for public access on their respective official websites. The information contained herein is for the exclusive use on the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM) only. Under no circumstances shall such information be used in the real world, including but not limited to, real-world air navigation or real-world air traffic control.

## 5. Language

This Letter of Agreement is officially and originally prepared and documented in the English language. Both parties are encouraged to translate this LOA into Vietnamese and/or Simplified Chinese for reference purposes, but this is optional. The English version of this LOA shall always prevail, and future revisions to this LOA shall be based upon the English version.

## 6. General Procedures

### 6.1

Unless otherwise stated or coordinated, all transfers must be completed 10NM before the FIR boundary.

### 6.2

The separations between handovers need to be in accordance with the horizontal and vertical separations specified in ICAO Doc 4444.

### 6.3

There are differences between China's flight levels and international flight levels. To avoid this difference affecting traffic, all handovers must be in feet and completed within China.

### 6.4

All handoffs between VATPRC and VCL vACC adopt silent transfer. Controllers will only accept radar tags if two-way communication is established.

## 7. Control Airspace definitions

### 7.1 Mainland China ATC

#### 7.1.1 Sanya ACC

- Position: ZJSA_CTR; Callsign: Sanya Control
- There are 2 split sectors in Sanya ACC. Sanya ACC Land sector (ZJSY_L_CTR) and Sanya ACC Oceanic sector (ZJSY_O_CTR).
- The Sanya ACC Land sector covers the whole of Hainan Island and the upper airspace (S0780/F256 and above) of Zhanjiang TMA. This sector uses fully metric operations.
- The Sanya ACC Oceanic sector covers the oceanic area and uses fully imperial operations from F140 up to F410. The airspace below F140 is uncontrolled.
- PRC_FSS (Callsign: Beijing Control) shall be responsible for Sanya ACC above S0780 (F256) (not incl.) when none of the Sanya ACC controllers are online.
- PRC_FSS can accept the handover on coordination, but only if their cruising level is higher than S0780 (F256).
- The horizontal boundary of Sanya ACC is shown in Figure 7.1
- Handoffs to Sanya ACC shall be made in the following order:
  - ZJSY_L_CTR/ZJSY_O_CTR -> ZJSA_CTR -> PRC_FSS (Above S0780/F256)
