## 6. General Procedures

### 6.1

Unless otherwise stated or coordinated:

#### 6.1.1

Enroute controllers (CTR) of both parties shall keep traffic away from the 5 nautical miles (nm) margin of the boundary between Hong Kong FIR (VHHK), Guangzhou FIR (ZGZU), Shanghai FIR (ZSHA) and Sanya FIR (ZJSA) under all circumstances. The margins on both sides constitute a buffer zone of a width of 10nm. Except during a standard handover procedure, the controller in charge of the corresponding airspace or sector must coordinate and point out such aircraft to the controller of the other party when it becomes necessary for traffic to enter or cross such margin.

#### 6.1.2

Due to the proximity of the approach path of runway 07L at VHHH and runway 33/34 at ZGSZ, Controllers shall keep traffic away from the Hong Kong - Zhuhai Airspace Boundary Non-Transgression Zone, except when following a published procedure. Controllers should immediately vector the aircraft away from the Hong Kong - Zhuhai Airspace Boundary Non-Transgression Zone if a pilot deviates from a published procedure.

##### 6.1.2.1

The Hong Kong - Zhuhai Airspace Boundary Non-Transgression Zone is defined as follows:

> N021.37.33.223 E112.55.49.939
>
> N021.31.58.768 E112.58.16.015

>
> N021.37.33.223 E112.55.49.939

#### 6.1.3

Controllers shall make every effort to follow the radar separation minima defined in ICAO Doc 4444. In addition, controllers shall also comply with the separation methods provided by the AIP of Hong Kong, the AIP of Macau, and the AIP of Mainland China.

##### 6.1.3.1

As per ENR 2.2.2.3 Section 4.5 of AIP of Mainland China for IFR:

> **“For aircraft arriving at or departing from Macau at the same level and on the same route:**
>
> - Arrival: **Minimum longitudinal** separation shall be **5 minutes (or 30 NM)** when the aircraft crosses the transfer of control point between Zhuhai Approach and Hong Kong.
> - Departure: **Minimum longitudinal** separation shall be **5 minutes** when aircraft crosses the transfer of control point between Macau and Zhuhai Approach.”

##### 6.1.3.2

As per ENR 1.2 Section 4 of AIP of Mainland China for VFR:

> **“The separation between aircraft operating on the same track and at same altitude shall not be less than:**
>
> - 2000m①: when aircraft cruising indicated airspeed is less than 250km/h②; or
> - 5000m①: when aircraft cruising indicated airspeed is 250km/h② or above.”
>
> **Remarks:**
>
> ① 2000m = 1NM; 5000m = 3NM
>
> ② 250km/h = 135kt

#### 6.1.4

Controllers of each side shall generally initiate each handover **ten to thirty nautical miles (10-30 nm)** before crossing the Transfer of Control Point (TCP). In the absence of identifiable operational conflicts, controllers are encouraged to initiate early transfer. Handoff must be completed at least **ten nautical miles (10nm) for IFR or three nautical miles (3nm) for VFR** from the TCP.

#### 6.1.5

Conversion of altitude measurement units shall be performed according to Section 8 and Section 9 of this document prior to handoff.

#### 6.1.6

No controller shall clear an aircraft directly to a waypoint outside of the FIR at which the controller controls unless prior coordination is made, and proper permission of such clearance is obtained. This also applies when there is no en-route/ terminal ATC available at the adjacent FIR through which a flight will transit.

#### 6.1.7

Proper liaison between FIRs shall be established for handover. **Controllers shall advise any cruising level changes (i.e., the altitude at which the aircraft will be flying during the handover) of a particular aircraft prior to entering neighboring FIR.** As per ICAO Doc 4444 Section 5.3.3.1, aircraft may not be cleared to change altitude during a handoff unless prior clearance has been obtained from the accepting controller. _Controllers may request an altitude different from the ones specified in Section 7 of this LOA document from the receiving controller with prior coordination._

#### 6.1.8

Controllers shall ensure that all aircraft are flying under **real-time speed (1x rate)** prior to the initiation of a handover and during a handover. **Crossing FIR boundary while under acceleration mode is strictly prohibited.**

#### 6.1.9

Enroute or Terminal controllers should advise controllers of the other FIR when a sector is combined or separated and provide corresponding information.

#### 6.1.10

If the route of the filed flight plan of a flight flying between FIRs does not include a valid TCP or does not include an airway that contains the valid TCP, a controller shall amend the route of such flight plan following standard procedures as per ICAO Doc 4444 so that the amended route will include a valid TCP. If the pilot is unable to amend their route, proper coordination shall be made to accommodate such situations.

#### 6.1.11

Controllers should refer to the Sector Ownership Priority table in Appendix B to determine which position to handoff to. If sectorization deviates from this standard (e.g., due to extra sectorization during events), controllers must explicitly coordinate this through ATC channels or otherwise.

#### 11.3.1

Per the AIP of Macau S.A.R., flights departing from runway 34 of Macau International Airport (VMMC) shall not overshoot Jiuzhou VOR (ZAO) due to noise abatement for Zhuhai.

#### 11.3.2

If runway 34 is in use and the aircraft is non-RNAV, Hong Kong ATC shall notify Mainland China ATC and instruct the aircraft to fly a heading as coordinated with Mainland China ATC (usually 040) after departure. If the pilot insists on flying conventional procedures, coordination must take place.

#### 11.3.3

When runway 34 is in use at Macau International Airport (VMMC), Macau Tower shall obtain a release from Zhuhai Approach(if online) for departing IFR aircraft prior to issuing takeoff clearance. Once this release has been obtained, only then is Macau Tower allowed to issue takeoff clearance to an aircraft.

### 11.4 Initial Altitude for Departing Flights from Macau International Airport (VMMC)

#### 11.4.1 Runway 34 departure

- All directions – S0120

#### 11.4.2 Runway 16 departure

- To Hong Kong direction – 4000ft
- To other Guangzhou directions - S0120

### 11.5 Procedure in the Absence of Mainland China ATC

#### 11.5.1

This section defines the procedures when all Mainland China ATC are offline. This deviates from the AIP of Macau as the absence only takes place on an online network.

#### 11.5.2

**RWY 34 Departure towards LUKBU and missed approach towards MC411** – After takeoff/missed approach, Macau Tower shall instruct aircraft with the following phraseology: “<callsign>, leaving controlled airspace, monitor Advisory Frequency 122.8, report passing LUKBU/MC411 on <next controller frequency>.”

#### 11.5.3

**RWY 16 arrival via INDUS** – Upon reaching INDUS, Hong Kong ATC shall instruct aircraft with the following phraseology: “<callsign>, leaving controlled airspace, monitor Advisory Frequency 122.8, report established on the localiser runway 16 on <next controller frequency>.”

#### 11.5.4

Hong Kong ATC is responsible for all VMMC departing and arriving traffic except runway 34 departures to Guangzhou FIR.

### 11.6 Procedure in the Absence of Hong Kong ATC

#### 11.6.1

This section shall define the procedures when all Hong Kong ATC are offline. This deviates from the AIP of Macau as the absence only takes place on an online network.

#### 11.6.2

**RWY 34 arrival** – Mainland China ATC shall instruct aircraft to monitor Advisory Frequency (122.800) upon reaching waypoint ROMEO or MCU VOR.

#### 11.6.3

**RWY 34 missed approach** – Macau Tower (if online) shall instruct traffic on the missed approach to tune to Mainland China ATC after the initial right turn. After passing LUKBU or MC411, Mainland China ATC shall instruct the aircraft to monitor Advisory Frequency (122.800).

#### 11.6.4

**RWY 16 arrival via INDUS** – Traffic shall contact Mainland China ATC upon crossing INDUS. After establishing on MCS LOC (LOC/DME approach) or reaching MC510 (RNAV-GNSS) Mainland China ATC may instruct the aircraft to:

- Monitor Advisory Frequency (122.800) if Macau Tower is offline; or,
- Contact Macau Tower if it is online.

#### 11.6.5

**RWY 16 departure** – for SIDs entering Zhuhai TMA, Macau Tower shall directly hand traffic off to Mainland China ATC after departure.

#### 11.6.6

**RWY 16 missed approach** – Traffic shall contact Mainland China ATC upon passing INDUS.

## 12. Special Agreement on FIR Boundary

### 12.1

There are differences between the depiction of the boundary line in the AIP of Hong Kong (shown in Figure 12.1) and that in the AIP of Mainland China (shown in Figure 12.2). To follow real-world operations, and to avoid unnecessary handoffs, on VATSIM, Hong Kong vACC and VATPRC use actual controlling boundaries as the FIR boundary. (shown in Figure 12.3).

#### 12.1.1

To comply with the real-world operation, Mainland China ATC will transfer aircraft as per Section 6.1.4,. while Hong Kong ATC will transfer aircraft prior to them reaching the line specified by the following coordinates:

> N022.47.09.363 E116.05.41.000
>
> N022.43.05.999 E116.10.05.999
>
> N022.56.21.001 E117.18.42.001
>
> N023.00.00.000 E117.30.00.000
